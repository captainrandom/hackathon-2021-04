Hello OCRUG.
I am pleased to announce that OCRUG has set up an email listserv to reach out to our members. This gives you full control over what type of messages you will receive.

I am very excited to announce that we will be hosting a Virtual Data Science Hackathon on April 10-11, 2021. During this weekend-long event, you will be able to take tutorials from some of the best data science instructors in the OC. You will work in a team to hack on a rich dataset and develop insights. There will be a mix of seasoned professionals and people just starting out so this will be a great way to network while having fun. There will have data science experts available throughout the event to give you a hand and guide you through the process. Plus, there will be some games and prizes too.

Here is the event's [repository](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2021-04) with more information.

The event has sold out the last 4-years and we expect to sell-out again this year. So, sign-up early at https://tinyurl.com/ocrug-hackathon-2021-05

Cheers
John Peach
