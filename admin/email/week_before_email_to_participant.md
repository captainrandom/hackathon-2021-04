    1. The event Zoom link will be sent out prior to the event to the email address you used to register on EventBright.

    1. If you are not on the [OCRUG Slack channel](https://socalrug.slack.com/) please [sign-up](https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/). 
    1. Join the **#hackathon-2021-04** channel in Slack. This is a great place to ask for help while getting set-up for the hackathon.
1. Information for the hackathon is kept in the [hackathon-2021-04](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2021-04) GitHub repository.  If you are unfamiliar with Git, you can download all the files in the repository by:
    1. Visit the [main repository page](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2021-04).
    1. Click the green **Code** button and select **Download ZIP**.
    1. Unzip the file to access the all the contents in the repository.
1. Make sure your coding environment, tools, and other software you plan to use for the hackathon are ready to go.  Time will go quickly during the event, and it will be useful to work out any technical issues in advance.  If you have any technical questions, feel free to post them to the **#hackthon-2021-04** Slack channel.
1. Please prepare a short (approx. 1 min) introduction about yourself, what you do, how you got into data and analytics, etc.  You'll use this for short introductions to others during our Saturday night event.


## Other Details

1. The hackathon will kick-off with an *optional* tutorial session on Saturday morning at 10 AM PDT.  The tutorials will cover basic data manipulation, analysis, and visualization with R.  These tutorials assume basic proficiency with R, though R beginners or those who use other languages may find the tutorials useful for reference.  If these topics are not of interest to you, please feel free to skip them.
1. The first **required** session is the Introduction session on Saturday at 1 PM PDT.  Participants must attend to participate in the hackathon.  During the Introduction, we'll cover an overview of the event, form teams, and release the hackathon data set.
1. Participants will be randomly assigned into teams, approximately 5 members each.  We will create the teams during the Introduction session.
1. Further details and questions will be covered during the Saturday Introduction session.


Looking forward to "seeing" everyone soon!
